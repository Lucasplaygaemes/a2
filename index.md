# a2 - A Modal Text Editor for the Terminal

Welcome to `a2`, a lightweight, fast, and configurable modal text editor inspired by Vim, written in C with ncurses.

## Core Features

- **Modal Editing:** Efficiently edit text with Normal, Insert, and Visual modes.
- **Workspaces & Splits:** Organize your work across multiple workspaces, each with its own layout of split windows.
- **Fuzzy Finder:** Quickly find and open any file in your project with a fuzzy search (`Alt+F`).
- **Command Palette:** A searchable command palette (`Alt+T`) for easy access to all editor commands.
- **File Explorer:** A built-in file explorer (`:explorer`) to navigate and manage files.
- **LSP Support:** Language Server Protocol integration for real-time diagnostics and code completion.
- **Combined Autocompletion:** Pressing `Tab` provides a unified list of suggestions from both the LSP and local words in the buffer.
- **Macros:** Record and play back sequences of commands (`q` and `@`) to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Advanced Search & Replace:** A powerful `:s` command to perform targeted text substitutions.
- **Theming:** Customize the editor's appearance with simple `.theme` files. Several themes like Solarized, Monokai, and Dracula are included.
- **Project Management:** Save and load project sessions, including open files, window layouts, and cursor positions for quick context switching.
