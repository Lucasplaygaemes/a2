## A2
A2 is an text editor vim alike and emacs alike, this isn't a project where i want to surpass or be in the same ground as those two, making it for hobby and to learn C better!

# Documentation!
Documentation is in - [**Documentation**](./index.md)

# New Release!
A lot of things were added! So, any doubt's of keyboard shortcuts? :ksc show all of them.
Use the command "help" to see the man pages.

# Spell!
Now, with a great effort, a new spell checker was added! What kind of text editor don't have a spell checker?
It's using Hunspell to work! It will be downloaded with the editor, and English will come as default.
There is a command to use it, and it's in the manual, but, to make this and everything a lot more eaiser, i will add...

# Setting Menu!
I will add an menu! to help to set configurations in the a2!
It will contain the things about it, and you will be able to download languages for the spell checker from there!
It will probably contain too the settings panel for the plugins, that we discuss later.


# Refactoring
The code has 2 main parts that need to be refactored, the main structure, EditorState and the way that the code handles inputs, isn't the best also, so updates will be made to make it better, but those will take time, and so will delay others things.

# Projects
Now you can save "projects", the windows, workspaces, and files you open, all of them can be open with just a command!
More explanation are in the Documentation!

# Themes!
Now a2 have themes! and they are quite easy to make, Themes will be searched in the default app folder, but, if no found, or if you want to add another folder, you can with the command :set themedir <dir>

# Assembly!
Becasue i'm learning assembly, a new function was added to the code to help me understand better what C functions turned in what in assembly, i will fix any bugs that i find.
This is a things that i made mostly of fun and learning experience!

# Multiplatform?
a2 isn't compatible with windows, and problably not with mac too.
I haven't tested a2 in a lot of distros yet, but it does work in Debian and distros based in him, and in fedora, if possible the next target is arch.
