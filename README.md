A2 is an text editor vim alike and emacs alike, this isn't a project where i want to surpass or be in the same ground as those two, making it for hobby and to learn C better!

# Documentation!
Documentation is in - [**Documentation**](./index.md)
# New Release!
A lot of things were added! So, any doubt's of keyboard shortcuts? :ksc show all of them.
Use the command "help" to see the man pages.
Now you can run if not any, most of the termial apps and a terminal by it self inside a2!

#Projects
Now you can save "projects", the windows, workspaces, and files you open, all of them can be open with just a command!

# Themes!
Now a2 have themes! and they are quite easy to make, Themes will be searched in the default app folder, but, if no found, or if you want to add another folder, you can with the command :set themedir <dir>

# Multiplatform?
a2 is not windows compatible without any modifications i think. I don't plan to make it. Not for now at least
